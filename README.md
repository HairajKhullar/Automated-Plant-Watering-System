System Design & Development:
Designed and built an automated plant watering system using Java, and Arduino.
Created a compact and scalable design tailored for small-scale and home gardening applications.

Sensor Integration:
Integrated soil moisture sensors to monitor real-time soil conditions.
Configured the sensors to trigger the water pump when moisture drops below a defined threshold.

Watering Mechanism:
Implemented a relay-controlled water pump to automate the watering process.
Optimized the watering cycle based on sensor feedback to prevent overwatering or underwatering.

User Interface:
Added an LCD display to show real-time soil moisture levels and system activity.
Developed user-friendly controls for manual override and system calibration.

Software Development:
Programmed sensor data handling and pump control logic in C++ for the Arduino microcontroller.
Used Java to simulate and test the system logic before hardware deployment.

Efficiency & Scalability:
Designed the system to be energy-efficient and adaptable for various plant setups.
Ensured the system could be easily scaled or modified for different environments.
